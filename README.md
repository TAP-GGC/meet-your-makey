# Synthetic Instruments

### Project Description
The [Technical Ambassador Program](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/schools/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program/), an Outreach research program to improve technological literacy- in order to engage and teach students about new technologies and algorithmic thinking. A common issue when teaching students about programming is that it doesnâ€™t feel practical or tactile; an easy way to improve the learning experience is to bring it into the physical world. Makey Makey, a simple circuit completing device which allows everyday objects to replace keyboard keys, allows students to interact with programs in basic but engaging ways. By allowing students to physically build an instrument using the kit and various conductive materials, they will have the creative freedom to design and play these instruments in whichever manner they choose.

### Usage
![Usage Picture](https://i.ibb.co/RPjpy3x/index2.png)
* 1. Input Mapper
	* There are eight keys (W,A,S,D,F,G,Left,Right) with instrument sound attached to them
	* Pressing down on those key will move the corresponding icon, and play the sound
* 2. Volume Control
	* Pressing up and down arrow on your key will rotate all the icon and change the pitch
* 3. Music Player
	* Play - Plays music function in the music script (res://script/Music.gd)
	* Reset - Stop the music and reset the timer
* 4. Recorder
	* Record - Will record keyboard input, and output code representing the note played, time played, duration
	* Clear - Clear out the textbox
* 4. Instrument Tab
	* Cello - Switch to cello
	* Drum - Switch to drum
