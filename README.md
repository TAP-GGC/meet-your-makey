# Using Technology to Create Synthetic Instruments and Engage Students While Teaching Algorithmic Skills
# Project Description
A common issue when teaching students about programming is that it doesnâ€™t feel practical or tactile; an easy way to improve the learning experience is to bring it into the physical world. Makey Makey, a simple circuit completing device which allows everyday objects to replace keyboard keys, allows students to interact with programs in basic but engaging ways. By allowing students to physically build an instrument using the kit and various conductive materials, they will have the creative freedom to design and play these instruments in whichever manner they choose
